/* This library implements utilities to parse the wave format used in the
 * CSCE317 course. This library is intended to only offer read-only
 * functionality for students completing their assignments using C or C++. A
 * much more featureful library is provided in Python, which supports
 * read/write, and can also convert to and from VCD. Note that the grade.sh
 * tool provided with the assignments skeleton breaks out the VCD<->plaintext
 * converter so it can be used from the shell.
 *
 * Note that this library is not intended to be robust against bad inputs or
 * improper usage.
