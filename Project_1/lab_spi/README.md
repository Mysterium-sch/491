# Introduction

In this lab, you will implement a protocol decoder which can decode an SPI
signal. This lab has several components. In the first component, you will
decode simple two-exchange transactions, next you will extend your code
to decode both two-exchange and streaming transactions. Finally, you will
add support for handling arbitrary values of CPOL and CPHA.

Note that the rubric for this lab is structured so that students who correctly
complete the first part will get a C, students who complete the first and
second parts a B, and students who complete all three an A.

# Your Code

You will write your code in the `code/` directory. It will be graded by running
`cd ./code ; make`, and then running test cases on `./a.out`. In between each
test case, your code will be cleaned using `cd ./code ; make clean`. All
compilation and grading will use the CSCE Linux labs as a reference system
(e.g. if you can show your code works on one of the Linux lab machines, it will
be considered to work for the purposes of this course). **Be sure to test your
code in the Linux labs even if you write it on your own personal system**.

You may use any programming language for which a compiler or interpreter is
provided in the Linux labs, with the following caveats:

* We will provide you with templates for C and Python. If you choose to use a
  different language, you accept full responsibility for ensuring your
  `Makefile` works with the provided grading script.

  * The TAs will help you with solving the projects only on a best-effort
    basis if you use a language other than Python or C.

* You may use third-party libraries or tools for aspects of your program which
  are not related to the lab assignment; for example, a student completing the
  project in C might choose to integrate a third-party hash-table library. You
  **must** clearly document the origin of any such libraries and clearly
  indicate they are not your own work.

  * For students using Python, please create an appropriate `requirements.txt`
    file in the same folder as your makefile.

* You **may not** use libraries or tools which solve the assignment for you.
  For example, using an off-the-shelf protocol decoder as a library constitutes
  cheating and is not permitted.

# Running Your Code

We will run your code via the provided `grade.sh` script. You can run your code
through all test cases provided using the shell command `sh grade.sh`. The
grading script can also run only specific tests, and supports other more
advanced options for debugging. Please run `sh grade.sh --help` for more
information.

Keep in mind, the `grade.sh` script **is the only supported way to run your
code**. Especially if you use Python, it is important you run your code via
this script or it will not be setup with the proper virtual environment.

After running normally, the `sh grade.sh` script will display your anticipated
score on the assignment. This score is an **estimate** based on the performance
of your program with the provided test cases. Your code will be graded using
different test cases, however the test cases we provide will be representative
to the greatest extent possible (e.g. edge cases in the test cases uses for
grading will also appear in the ones we provide as examples).

Before you run your code, you should create the file `userid.txt` in the same
folder as your `Makefile`. In this file, you should write your UofSC network
ID. For example, if your school email is `jsmith@email.sc.edu`, you should
write `jsmith` into the `userid.txt` file.

# Requirements

You will write a program which reads in pre-recorded signal data, which will
allow it to determine the value of various digital signals at specific points
in time. The following signals are present in the input waveform:

* `cpha` - CPHA value for the SPI bus (guaranteed to be 0 except in part 3).
* `cpol` - CPOL value for the SPI bus (guaranteed to be 0 except in part 3).
* `miso` - MISO (master in slave out) signal for the SPI bus.
* `mosi` - MOSI (master out slave in) signal for the SPI bus.
* `sclk` - SCLK (serial clock) signal for the SPI bus.
* `ss` - SS (slave select) signal for the SPI bus - **active low**.

**Note**: note that a correct solution to part 2 is also a correct solution to
part 1, and a correct solution to part 3 is also a correct solution to parts 1
and 2. Thus, you do not need to write multiple separate programs.

**Note**: All hexadecimal numbers should be formatted **without** a leading `0x`
and in all-lowercase, and left-zero-padded to be a full byte long.

**Note**: for all parts of this assignment, you should assume that SPI data is
transmitted in MSB-first bit order.

**Note**: for all parts of this assignment, you may assume that the bus does
not have any signal transmission errors, and that all transactions are fully
complete (e.g. we don't expect you to handle invalid, corrupted, or partial
transactions).

## Part 1 - Two-Exchange Transactions

In Part 1, the SPI bus will always have the settings CPHA=0, CPOL=0, and will
only contain transactions that contain exactly two exchanges. Each transaction
can represent either a read or a write. Both types of transactions begin with a
transaction from the master to the slave, where the slave transmits only 0
values to the master, and the master transmits a byte with the following
format:

| bits 7 (MSB)...2 | bit 1      | bit 0 (LSB) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| address          | read/write | stream      |

Thus, the master transmits a 6 bit address, followed by a `1` if a write is
requested, and a `0` if a read is requested. Finally, the `stream` field will
always be 0 for this part of the lab.

If the first exchange was a read request, the second exchange will send 0 from
the master to the slave, and an arbitrary data byte from the slave to the
master.

If the first exchange was a write request, the second exchange will send an
arbitrary data byte from the master to the slave, and 0 from the slave to the
master.

Your program must process the data from the SPI bus, and output a textual log
of what events occurred on the bus. Your program will output one line of output
for each transaction, in the following format:

* For a read request, the output should be `RD <address> <value>`, where
  `<address>` is replaced by the address in hexadecimal, and `<value>` is
  replaced with the value the slave responded with, also in hexadecimal.

* For a write request, the output should be `WR <address> <value>` where
  `<address>` is replaced by the address in hexadecimal, and `<value>` is
  replaced with the value the master wrote to the slave.


As an example, consider the following signal trace:

![](./lab_spi/waves1.png)

This trace contains three two-exchange transactions:

* The first writes to address `0x30` the value `0xd5`.
* The second writes to address `0x0b` the value `0x9a`.
* The third reads from the address `0x0d` and gets the value `0x15` as a result.

This should correspond to the following output:

```plaintext
WR 30 d5
WR 0b 9a
RD 0d 15
```

You can test your code against just this simple example using the command
`sh grade.sh --only case000`.

You can test your code against just the test cases for part 1 using this
command: `sh grade.sh --only $(cd test_cases ; echo part1_*)`.


## Part 2 - Streaming Transactions

In part 2, the SPI bus will work exactly as in part 1, except that for some
transactions, the `stream` bit may be set to `1`. In this case, the second
exchange will always be from the master to the slave, and will encode a value
*N* (in this exchange, the slave always transmits 0 to the master).

The subsequent *N* many exchanges will be sent either from the master to the
slave or the slave to the master (depending on whether the read/write flag is 1
or 0 respectively).

Your program must still output data in the same format as in part 1, but in the
event that a transaction is encountered where the `stream` field is 1, it
should instead output data in the following format:

* For a read request, the output should be `RD STREAM <address> <value 1>
  <value 2> ... <value n>`, where the `<address>` is replaced with the address
  read, and the `<value >`s replaced with the values streamed in order.

* For a read request, the output should be `WR STREAM <address> <value 1>
  <value 2> ... <value n>`, where the `<address>` is replaced with the address
  read, and the `<value >`s replaced with the values streamed in order.

**NOTE**: *N* will never be greater than 32.

**NOTE**: the output from your program is whitespace-sensitive, take care not
to accidentally leave a trailing whitespace while concatenating the list of
values.

As an example, consider the following example:

![](./lab_spi/waves2.png)

This signal trace contains three transactions and 11 exchanges, which are shown
in the following table:

| timestamp   | slave to master | master to slave |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1100.000000 | 00              | 59              |
| 1900.000000 | 00              | 03              |
| 2700.000000 | a5              | 00              |
| 3500.000000 | bf              | 00              |
| 4300.000000 | 4d              | 00              |
| 5250.000000 | 00              | 74              |
| 6050.000000 | 24              | 00              |
| 7000.000000 | 00              | f5              |
| 7800.000000 | 00              | 02              |
| 8600.000000 | 9a              | 00              |
| 9400.000000 | ba              | 00              |

Transaction 1:

* The first exchange sends the byte `0x59` to the slave, which corresponds to
  an address of `0x16`, with a read/write flag of 0 (signifying a read), and a
  stream flag of 1, indicating this is a streaming transaction.

* The next exchange sends the byte `0x03` to the slave, indicating a streaming
  read of 3 bytes.

* The subsequent 3 transactions send the values `0x15`, `0xbf`, and `0x4d` from
  the slave to the master.

Transaction 2:

* The first exchange sends the byte `0x74` to the slave, indicating an address
  of `0x1d`, a read/write flag of 0, and a stream flag of 0, indicating
  this is a single read operation.

* The second exchange sends the byte `0x24` from the slave to the master.

Transaction 3:

* The first exchange sends the byte `0xf5` from the master to the slave,
  indicating an address of 0x3d, a read/write flag of 0, and a stream flag of
  1, indicating a streaming read.

* The second exchange sends the byte `0x02` from the master to the slave,
  indicating that the streaming read is of length 2.

* The final two exchanges send the bytes `0x9a` and `0xba` from the slave to
  the master.

This should correspond to the following output:

```plaintext
RD STREAM 16 a5 bf 4d
RD 1d 24
RD STREAM 3d 9a ba
```

You can test your code against just this simple example using the command
`sh grade.sh --only case001`.

You can test your code against just the test cases for part 2 using this
command: `sh grade.sh --only $(cd test_cases ; echo part2_*)`.

## Part 3

In part 3, the SPI bus will work exactly as in part 2, and the output format of
your program will not change. However, your program must read the value of the
`cpol` and `cpha` signals when it first starts up and configure itself
accordingly. The observed behavior of the other bus signals is guaranteed to be
consistent with the settings for CPOL and CPHA.

**Note**: the value of CPOL and CPHA is guaranteed not to change during the
course of a given test case, but may vary between test cases.

**Hint**: you can reasonably expect that few if any test cases in part 3 will
have CPOL=0 and CPHA=0, so as to differentiate them from the test cases of part
2.

You can test your code against just the test cases for part 3 using this
command: `sh grade.sh --only $(cd test_cases ; echo part3_*)`.

# Submitting Your Code

When you are ready to turn in your code for grading, you should run the command
`sh grade.sh --pack`. A file will be created called
`lab_2023sp_spi_youruserid.tar.gz`, with `youruserid` replaced with whatever
user ID you specified previously.

# Rubric

Except for the example test case shown earlier in this document, all of the
other test cases are generated randomly. We will run your code on a similar
(but different) set of randomly generated test cases created by the same
program. The test cases are split into three sets corresponding to parts 1, 2,
and 3. Your score on each part will be equal to the fraction of test cases you
got right in each part.

* part 1 - 72 points
* part 2 - 16 points
* part 3 - 12 points

Total points possible: 100.

By design, students completing part 1 only will earn a C, students completing
parts 1 and 2 a B, and students completing all three parts an A.

**Note**: you can view your overall score even if some test cases throw errors
using the command `sh grade.sh --continue`.

**Note**: due to implementation details of the grading script, you will see an
"estimated score" on a scale of 30 points - note that this will be re-scaled to
be out of 100 points (e.g. look at the percentage score, not the point counts).

# Appendices

## Appendix A - Input Data Format

**Note that parsing libraries are provided in the project templates for C and
Python. You do not need to write your own parser for the input data format
unless you are using a language other than C or Python.** If you are using
C or Python and wish to write your own parser, this is allowed but not
recommended. You are solely responsible for any errors resulting from
improperly written parsers.

Input data will be provided in the following format:

* The first line of input will contain a single unsigned decimal integer
  number, indicating the number of data samples in the file. Call this value
  *n*.

* The second line of input will contain a list of signal names, delineated
  using tab characters.

* The third line of the file will contain the size of each signal in bits as an
  unsigned decimal number, delineated by tab characters, such that the *k*-th
  size is associated with the *k*-th signal name from the second line.

* The remaining *n* lines will each contain data samples, consisting of a
  floating-point timestamp, followed by signal values as unsigned decimal
  integers, such that the *k*-th integer corresponds to the *k*-th signal name
  from the second line.

* The value of a signal is assumed not to change between data samples.

* Data samples need not occur at any particular interval in terms of timestamp.

* Timestamps are unitless; they represent some arbitrary amount of time, unless
  the assignment description prescribes a particular unit of time.

Any lines which begin with any amount of whitespace followed by a `#` character
should be ignored as comments, and parsing should resume as normal after a `\n`
character is encountered.

For example, consider the file:

```plaintext
4
s0	s1	clk
1	3	1
0.001	1	3	0
0.002	0	2	0
0.003	1	3	1
0.004	0	0	0
```

This file indicates that:

* There are three signals, named `s0`, `s1`, and `clk`.
* The signal `s1` is three bits in size, and the signals `s0` and `clk` are
  each one bit in size.
* At time `0.001`, the signal `s0` has a value of `0b1`, the signal `s1` has a
  value of `0b011`, and the signal `clk` has a value of `0b0`
* At time `0.002`, the signal `s0` has a value of `0b0`, the signal `s1` has a
  value of `0b010`, and the signal `clk` has a value of `0b0`
* At time `0.003`, the signal `s0` has a value of `0b1`, the signal `s1` has a
  value of `0b011`, and the signal `clk` has a value of `0b1`
* At time `0.004`, the signal `s0` has a value of `0b0`, the signal `s1` has a
  value of `0b000`, and the signal `clk` has a value of `0b0`


## Appendix B - Python Library Documentation

Full documentation can be seen in the docstring comments in
`utils/python_utils/waves.py`. A summary is provided below.

You will need to instance one `Waves` object by using `w = Waves()` (you can
use a variable name other than `w` if you wish). You can then load data into it
using `w.loadText(string)`. For example, to load all data on standard input,
`w.loadText(sys.stdin.read())`. An example is provided in the project template.

Sample data for the Waves object `w` is stored in `w.data`, which is an array.
The *i*-th array element stores the sample data for sample index *i*. The array
elements are tuples of two elements; the first element is the floating-point
timestamp at which the sample was collected, and the second is a dictionary
associating signal names with the value that signal had at the given timestamp.

In short:

* The value of the signal `"x"` at sample index `i` is given by
  `w.data[i][1]["x"]`.

* The timestamp of sample index `i` is given by `w.data[i][0]`.

Summary of useful functions for a given Waves object `w`:

* `w.signals() -> list[str]` - return a list of signals in the object.

* `w.samples() -> int` - return the total number of samples stored in the
  object.

* `w.indexOfTime(time: float) -> int` - return the sample index for the given
  time value.

* `w.signalAt(signal: str, time: float) ->int` - return the value of the
  specified signal at the specified time.

* `w.nextEdge(signal: str, time: float, posedge: bool=True, negedge: bool=True)-> tuple[float, bool]`
  - return a tuple `(t, ok)` where `t >= time` is the time at which the next
  signal edge occurs for the given signal, and `ok` is `True` if an edge was
  found, and `False` otherwise.

  * `w.nextEdge("x", 0.3, posedge=True, negedge=False)` finds the next rising
    edge of the signal `"x"` which occurs at or after 0.3 time units.

* `w.loadText(text: str)` - overwrite the data stored in `w` with the contents
  of a file formatted as described in *Appendix A*.


## Appendix C - C Library Documentation

Please view `utils/c_utils/waves.h` for full C library documentation. An
example of usage is provided in the C project template.

## Appendix D - Log Format

For each test case that is run, a folder will be created,
`./log/testcasename/`. This folder may contain the following files:

* `explain.err` - standard error from the `explain.sh` script (usually only
  useful to TAs).
* `explain.out` - standard out from the `explain.sh` script (usually only
  useful to TAs).
* `make_clean.err` - standard error from running `make clean` before your
  code is run on the test case.
* `make_clean.out` - standard out from running `make clean` before your
  code is run on the test case.
* `make.err` - standard error from running `make` before your code is run
  on the test case.
* `make.out` - standard output from running `make` before your code is run
  on the test case.
* `run.err` - standard error from running your program on the test case input.
* `run.out` - standard output from running your program on the test case input.

## Appendix E - Environment Variables

For students who wish to write their own files into the log directory for a
test case, certain environment variables are exposed to the process running
under the grading script.

* `CSCE317_PROJECT_DIR` - the directory in which `grade.sh` resides.
* `CSCE317_CODE_DIR` - the directory where your code lives, where `make` is
  run.
* `CSCE317_CASE_ID` - the test case identifier of the case that is being run.
* `CSCE317_LOG_DIR` - the log directory for the running test case.

Utilizing these environment variables is not necessary to complete the
assignment, they are merely presented here for those that wish to use them.

## Appendix F - Viewing Input Files With `gtkwave`

To help you understand a particular test case better, you may wish to use the
[GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) VCD file viewer to display the
contents of a file formatted according to *Appendix A*. To do so, follow
these steps:

1. Ensure GTKWave is installed.
2. `sh grade.sh --vcd2txt test_cases/case002/input.txt temp.vcd`
  * Replace `case002` with the test case you are interested in.
3. `gtkwave temp.vcd`
4. `rm temp.vcd`
